ABSTRACT="Precoding transmissions in wireless MIMO systems is essential to enable
optimal utilization of the spatial degrees of freedom. However,
communicating the precoding matrices from the receiver is challenging,
owing to large feedback requirements. Past work has shown that predictive
quantization in time, as well as interpolation over frequency can be used
to reconstruct the precoders over a wide band, although these techniques
have not been used jointly. We propose both a predictive quantization as
well as a joint time-frequency interpolation strategy for precoding
matrices over the Stiefel manifold. The key insight that we use is that
local tangent spaces in the manifold permit effective combination of both
temporal and frequency domain information for more accurate precoder
reconstruction. Simulations reveal that we obtain a significant improvement
in achievable rate as well as BER reduction when compared to existing
strategies."
